# Transcriber

A prototype of an application for experimenting with Cocoa APIs used for transcribing audio. The app explores the following Apple frameworks:

- Speech
- AVFoundation

With the following classes:

- SFSpeechRecognizer
- AVAudioRecorder
- AVAudioPlayer

Don't use this app as an example of good software engineering. It is hacked together to try out stuff. There is no proper error handling and methods are not neatly factored into separate files for
better overview.
